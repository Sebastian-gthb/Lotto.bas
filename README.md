# Lotto.bas
My QBasic tool from 20th December 1994

This Programm helps to quickly find out if you have won in the german Lottery "Lotto 6aus49". You select the numbers that you have chose on the "Lottoschein" (maybe only a german thing?). You can save and load the selection. Finally, enter the lottery numbers drawn and press "Vergleich" (compare). The programm compare they with your selection.
You control the programm with the mouse.

The program code looks very ugly. Sorry!

The green numbers are for the drawn numbers. The blue one ist the extra number called "Zusatzzahl" and the red one ist the super number called "Superzahl". The super number has no funktion in this program. It is a special number on the pice of paper "Lottoschein".
